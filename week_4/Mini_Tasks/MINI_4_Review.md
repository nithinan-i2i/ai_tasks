# Code Review: `processUserForForm`

Hi team,

Thanks for the work on this function! It handles a lot of complex logic. I've reviewed the implementation and have a couple of suggestions to improve its robustness and maintainability.

### 1. Separate Data Processing from Side-Effects

**Observation:** The function currently mixes pure data transformation (filtering roles, creating `emailHash`) with a side-effect (the `fetch` call).

**Suggestion:** I recommend moving the `fetch` call out of this function. `processUserForForm` could be responsible only for preparing the user data for the form. The component that calls this function could then be responsible for triggering the API call.

**Benefit:** This change would make our function "pure" and deterministic. It would be easier to test, as we wouldn't need to mock an API call, and its behavior would be more predictable.

### 2. Improve Safety of Data Access

**Observation:** The role validation logic currently identifies and logs blocked roles but doesn't actually stop them from being included in the `rolesToUse` array that gets passed to the form. Also, accessing the organization with `user.organizations[0]` could throw an error if the `organizations` array is empty.

**Suggestion:** Let's refine the `.filter()` logic to correctly exclude the blocked roles. For the organization access, we can use optional chaining (`user.organizations?.[0]`) to prevent runtime errors.

**Benefit:** These changes will make the function more resilient and prevent potential bugs from reaching production.

Overall, this is a great starting point. Let me know what you think of these suggestions!
