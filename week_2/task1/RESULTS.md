# User Management API: Testing & Results

## What Worked Well
- **Project Structure:** The layered architecture (controllers, services, models, middleware) was clean and maintainable.
- **SQLite Integration:** The database and user table were created automatically on first run.
- **JWT Authentication:** Protected routes (`PUT`/`DELETE /users/:id`) correctly required a valid JWT.
- **Validation:** Joi schemas prevented invalid data from being processed.
- **Logging:** Winston provided both console and file logging.
- **Testing:** Sample Jest tests and Postman requests for all endpoints worked as expected after fixes.
- **Partial Updates:** After refinement, partial updates (e.g., just updating the name) worked without errors.

## Gaps or Issues Identified
- **Partial Update Bug:** Initially, updating a user with only one field (e.g., name) caused a NOT NULL constraint error because missing fields were set to `undefined`.  
  **Fix:** Merged existing user data with new data before updating.
- **Password Field in getUserById:** The model's `getUserById` did not return the password, which was needed for merging during updates.  
  **Fix:** Modified the query to include the password field.
- **Folder Naming:** The folder was named `middleware/` instead of `middlewares/`, but this is a minor and non-blocking issue.
- **Entry Point Name:** The main file is `src/app.js` (not `server.js`), so documentation and commands should reference the correct entry point.

## Prompt Refinements Needed
- **Be Explicit About Partial Updates:** When asking for update endpoints, specify that partial updates should be supported and that missing fields should default to existing values.
- **Clarify Entry Point:** Specify the expected entry point filename (`app.js` or `server.js`) to avoid confusion.
- **Return All Needed Fields:** When merging data for updates, ensure that all required fields (including sensitive ones like password) are available from the database.
- **Testing Instructions:** Include a note to check for and handle NOT NULL constraint errors during update operations.

**Summary:**  
After prompt-driven refinements, the API is robust, supports all required features, and passes both automated and manual tests. The main issues were with partial update handling, which were resolved by improving data merging and model queries.
