# Comparison Analysis

## Which Pattern Implementation Was Best?
- **Strategy Pattern**

## What Made It Better?
- The Strategy Pattern implementation stands out due to its clear separation of concerns, extensibility, and real-world applicability. The use of an abstract class/interface, concrete strategies, and a context class demonstrates textbook usage of the pattern. The client code and tests are straightforward, and the pattern's benefits (dynamic selection, open/closed principle) are immediately clear in the payment processing context.
- The Observer and Factory patterns are also well-implemented, but the Strategy example is slightly more robust in demonstrating dynamic behavior and extensibility.

## How Could the Prompt Be Improved for Lower-Quality Outputs?
- **Be explicit about requirements:** Specify the need for async handling, error management, or real-world edge cases.
- **Request interface/abstract class usage:** This ensures proper abstraction and extensibility.
- **Ask for event filtering or more advanced features:** For Observer, mention event types or priorities.
- **Clarify test expectations:** Specify what should be tested (e.g., error cases, edge cases, async behavior).
- **Encourage production-readiness:** Ask for input validation, error handling, and comments.

**Summary:**
- All patterns are implemented well, but the Strategy Pattern is the most exemplary due to its clarity, extensibility, and alignment with best practices. Improving prompts with more explicit requirements and advanced features can help raise the quality of all implementations.
