# Payment Processing with Strategy Pattern

## Why Strategy Pattern Fits

The Strategy Pattern is ideal for scenarios where multiple algorithms (or behaviors) can be selected at runtime. In payment processing, different payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal, Bank Transfer) have unique validation and processing logic. By encapsulating each payment method as a separate strategy, the system can dynamically switch between them without modifying the checkout logic. This promotes:

- **Open/Closed Principle**: Easily add new payment methods without changing existing code.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each payment method handles its own validation and processing.
- **Flexibility**: The payment method can be selected or changed at runtime.

## Implementation Summary

- `PaymentStrategy`: Abstract class/interface for payment methods.
- `CreditCardStrategy`, `PayPalStrategy`, `BankTransferStrategy`: Concrete implementations with their own validation and process logic.
- `CheckoutContext`: Context class that uses a payment strategy and allows dynamic switching.
- `clientExample.js`: Demonstrates usage and dynamic selection.
- `paymentStrategy.test.js`: Unit tests for all strategies and context.
