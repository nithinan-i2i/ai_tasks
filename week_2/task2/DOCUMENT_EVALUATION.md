# Document Evaluation

## Strategy Pattern
- **Pattern Fit:** Good
  - The Strategy Pattern is well-suited for payment processing, allowing dynamic selection and encapsulation of payment logic. Each payment method is decoupled and easily extendable.
- **Code Quality:** 9/10
- **Improvements Needed:**
  - Add more robust validation for payment details.
  - Consider async processing for real-world payment gateways.

## Observer Pattern
- **Pattern Fit:** Good
  - The Observer Pattern is appropriate for event notification, enabling decoupled, dynamic subscription of services reacting to user actions.
- **Code Quality:** 9/10
- **Improvements Needed:**
  - Implement event filtering so observers can subscribe to specific event types.
  - Use async/await for observer actions that may involve I/O.

## Factory Pattern
- **Pattern Fit:** Good
  - The Factory Pattern is a strong fit for abstracting database connection creation, centralizing logic, and supporting multiple DB types.
- **Code Quality:** 9/10
- **Improvements Needed:**
  - Add error handling for invalid/missing config fields.
  - Consider supporting async connection logic for real DB clients.

---

**Overall:**
- Patterns are well-chosen and implemented for their respective scenarios.
- Code is clean, modular, and extensible.
- Minor improvements would make the code more production-ready.
