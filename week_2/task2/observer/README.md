# Event Notification with Observer Pattern

## Why Observer Pattern Fits

The Observer Pattern is ideal for scenarios where multiple, decoupled components need to react to events or changes in state. In an event notification system, when a user performs an action (like registering or placing an order), multiple services (such as email, logging, analytics) should respond independently. The Observer Pattern allows:

- **Loose Coupling:** Subjects and observers are decoupled, so new observers can be added without changing the subject.
- **Dynamic Subscription:** Observers can be added or removed at runtime.
- **Scalability:** Easily extend the system with new notification handlers.

## Implementation Summary

- `Observer`: Interface for all observers (services).
- `Subject`: Manages observers and notifies them of events.
- `EmailService`, `LogService`, `AnalyticsService`: Concrete observers that handle notifications.
- `clientExample.js`: Demonstrates adding/removing observers and triggering events.
- `observerPattern.test.js`: Unit tests for observer management and notifications.
