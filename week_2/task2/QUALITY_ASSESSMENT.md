## 2. Pattern Appropriateness

- **Strategy Pattern:**
  - Used for payment processing where multiple algorithms (payment methods) can be selected at runtime.
  - **Appropriate:** Yes, as it allows dynamic selection and encapsulation of payment logic.

- **Observer Pattern:**
  - Used for event notification where multiple services need to react to user actions independently.
  - **Appropriate:** Yes, as it decouples the subject from observers and allows dynamic subscription.

- **Factory Pattern:**
  - Used for database connection creation where the type of DB is determined at runtime and connection logic varies.
  - **Appropriate:** Yes, as it abstracts the instantiation logic and centralizes it.

## 3. SOLID Principles

### Strategy Pattern
- **Single Responsibility:** Each strategy handles its own validation/processing.
- **Open/Closed:** New payment methods can be added without modifying existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution:** All strategies can be used interchangeably via the interface.
- **Interface Segregation:** Only relevant methods are exposed.
- **Dependency Inversion:** Context depends on abstraction, not concrete strategies.

### Observer Pattern
- **Single Responsibility:** Subject manages observers; observers handle their own logic.
- **Open/Closed:** New observers can be added without changing the subject.
- **Liskov Substitution:** All observers can be used interchangeably.
- **Interface Segregation:** Observers only need to implement `update`.
- **Dependency Inversion:** Subject and observers depend on abstractions.

### Factory Pattern
- **Single Responsibility:** Factory handles creation; adapters handle connection logic.
- **Open/Closed:** New DB types can be added by extending the factory and adding adapters.
- **Liskov Substitution:** All adapters provide a `connect` method.
- **Interface Segregation:** Adapters only expose connection logic.
- **Dependency Inversion:** Client code depends on the factory/adapter abstraction.

## Summary

- All patterns are implemented appropriately for their use cases.
- The code is modular, extensible, and follows SOLID principles.
- Folder structure and documentation make the codebase easy to navigate and maintain.
