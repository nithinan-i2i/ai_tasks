# Backend Rules

## Task Execution
- Work sequentially through tasks_backend.md, unless dependencies allow parallel work.
- Mark tasks as completed in tasks_backend.md with a brief note of any deviations.

## Implementation Standards
- Use Express.js and Sequelize.
- All API inputs must be validated.
- Comprehensive error handling for all routes as per @docs/API_SPEC.md.
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms must strictly follow @docs/API_SPEC.md.
- Write unit tests for each endpoint/service, aiming for >80% coverage of new logic.
- Follow security best practices outlined in general_rules.mdc and specific to backend.
